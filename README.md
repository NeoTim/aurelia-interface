#Aurelia Interface

This project was previously a Google Material Design Library for the [Aurelia](http://www.aurelia.io/) platform. However, we've broadened the vision and scope of the project considerably since this repo was first set up.

What Is Aurelia Interface now?

Aurelia interface is an optional, commercial, highly affordable addon to Aurelia. It features a collection of custom HTML elements and attributes, built with Aurelia, which a developer can use to build cross-platform applications. These include simple widgets like buttons and select boxes as well as more complex widgets like data grids. The widgets automatically render with correct platform-specific styles, themes and behaviors. Thus, if your app is running on Android it will look and feel like a native Material Design UX. If it's running on iOS, it will look and feel like a native iOS app. Of course, you'll also be able to use them to build Web and Desktop apps. Aurelia Interface lets you write your app once and deploy it to multiple platforms with correct, platform-specific behavior effortlessly.
